This is an implementation of jgdavey/unicornleap with an Adventure Time theme. Built on top of changes that I made in my fork of Unicornleap.

The default installation prefix is /usr/local. You can change it with
the PREFIX env variable.

2.  Copy the binary from `build` folder to somewhere in your path
3.  Create 2 images at `~/.unicornleap/unicorn.png` and `~/.unicornleap/sparkle.png`
